Revision history for Perl extension TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::pgTAP.

3.26 2011-03-30T18:22:25
     - Fixed exit code in `pg_prove`. It no longer returns 0 on fail and 1 on
       pass. Thanks to Rod Taylor for the report!

3.25 2011-02-08T17:42:21
     - Fixed shebang line in `pg_prove` so that it will be properly rewritten
       upon installation.
     - The `-S/--set` option added in 3.24 is now properly passed to `psql`.
       Norman Yamada.

3.24  2011-01-13T22:26:47
     - Added -S/--set option to pg_prove to allow the setting of psql
       variables. Patch by Norman Yamada.

3.23  2010-09-08T22:32:05
      - Disable --failures by default.
      - Enable --comments by default. This is so that failure diagnostics will
        appear even when not in verbose mode. This is how the `pg_prove`
        distributed with pgTAP works. Use --no-comments or --quiet to disable
        them.

3.22  2010-08-15T01:06:08
      - Moved from the Test::Harness distribution to its own distribution.
      - No assume that a test string starting with "pgtap:" and is not a file
        name is SQL to be executed.
      - Moved `pg_prove` from the pgTAP distribution and rewrote it to use
        App::Prove and pgTAP.
      - Rewrote `pg_prove` to use App::Prove, thus gaining most of its
        features.
